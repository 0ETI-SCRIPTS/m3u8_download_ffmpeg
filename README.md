# M3U8 Download FFMPEG

Downloads and converts m3u8 files to mkv then to mp4  
- NOTE:
    - If directly coverting m3u8 to mp4, sometimes will be graphical glitches. 
    - Best to have mkv as a middleman.  

- Files:
    - index_old.py
        - Old Download script. Doesn't store downloads in groups
    - index.py
        - Does what index_old does not
